# Install Ubuntu {.unnumbered}

- This container uses [Ubuntu 22.04 - Jammy Jellyfish](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/).

- The image for Ubuntu is pulled directly from Docker in the first two lines of the definition file:

```
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu:22.04
```

  - Note that one can specify a newer version of Ubuntu using either
    ```
    # this
    Bootstrap: docker
    From: ubuntu:24.04
    
    # or that
    Bootstrap: docker
    From: ubuntu
    ```
