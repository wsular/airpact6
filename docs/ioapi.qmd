# Install I/O API {.unnumbered}

- [I/O API](https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/) is a library that facilitates input and output of netCDF files for CMAQ. To install it in the container, the I/O API repo is cloned into the container.

```
git clone https://github.com/cjcoats/ioapi-3.2.git
```

::: {.callout-important}
Installation of I/O API requires a customized version of Makefile.nocpl.
