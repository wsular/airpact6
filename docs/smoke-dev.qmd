# SMOKE {.unnumbered}

## v5.1
- Testing of SMOKE v5.1 **failed**. This testing is documented in [GitHub issue #9](https://github.com/wsular/airpact6/issues/9).

## v4.5

- I've decided to regress back to SMOKE v4.5
  - This is the version that is currently working on aeolus
  - I'm hoping that having v4.5 running on gaia may allow a smoother transition from aeolus to gaia, and from AIRPACT5 to AIRPACT6

### Installation
- Installation of SMOKE v4.5 is documented in [GitHub issue #19](https://github.com/wsular/airpact6/issues/19)

### Testing
- Testing of SMOKE v4.5 is documented in [GitHub issue #20](https://github.com/wsular/airpact6/issues/20)
