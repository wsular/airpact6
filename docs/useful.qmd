# Install useful commands and libraries {.unnumbered}

- Some useful commands and libraries are needed for subsequent installations of openMPI and the netCDF libraries. Here are the commands from the definition file to load useful stuff.

```
  apt -y install curl
  apt -y install m4
  apt -y install nano
  apt -y install tcsh
  apt -y install wget
  apt -y install zlib1g zlib1g-dev
  apt -y install libdispatch-dev
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  apt -y install git
```

  - Note that libdispatch must be on the path, so /usr/lib is added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
