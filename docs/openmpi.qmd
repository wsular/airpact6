# Install openMPI {.unnumbered}

- CMAQ is a program that uses the [Message Passing Interface (MPI)](https://www.mpi-forum.org). There are a few different libraries that can be used to add MPI functionality to this container. We have chosen [openMPI](https://www.open-mpi.org). Here are the commands that install openMPI in the container.

```
# ....Create shared directory
  mkdir -p $HOME

###################################################################
  #     Needed by openmpi
  apt -y install autoconf
  apt -y install automake
  apt -y install libtool
  apt -y install flex
  apt -y install pandoc

  # ....Install OpenMPI
  cd $HOME
  wget https://download.open-mpi.org/release/open-mpi/v4.0/openmpi-4.0.1.tar.gz
  tar xvfz openmpi-4.0.1.tar.gz
  cd openmpi-4.0.1
  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
  make all install
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

  - The openMPI libraries are installed by default into /usr/local/lib, so this directory is added to the library path.
